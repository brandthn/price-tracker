Open Prices
What is Open Prices?
Open Prices is a project to collect and share prices of products around the world. It's a publicly available dataset that can be used for research, analysis, and more. Open Prices is developed and maintained by Open Food Facts.

There are currently few companies that own large databases of product prices at the barcode level. These prices are not freely available, but sold at a high price to private actors, researchers and other organizations that can afford them.

Open Prices aims to democratize access to price data by collecting and sharing product prices under an open licence. The data is available under the Open Database License (ODbL), which means that it can be used for any purpose, as long as you credit Open Prices and share any modifications you make to the dataset.

Dataset description
This dataset contains in Parquet format all price information contained in the Open Prices database. The dataset is updated daily.

Here is a description of the most important columns:

id: The ID of the price in DB
product_code: The barcode of the product, null if the product is a "raw" product (fruit, vegetable, etc.)
category_tag: The category of the product, only present for "raw" products. We follow Open Food Facts category taxonomy for category IDs.
labels_tags: The labels of the product, only present for "raw" products. We follow Open Food Facts label taxonomy for label IDs.
origins_tags: The origins of the product, only present for "raw" products. We follow Open Food Facts origin taxonomy for origin IDs.
price: The price of the product, with the discount if any.
price_is_discounted: Whether the price is discounted or not.
price_without_discount: The price of the product without discount, null if the price is not discounted.
price_per: The unit for which the price is given (e.g. "KILOGRAM", "UNIT")
currency: The currency of the price
location_osm_id: The OpenStreetMap ID of the location where the price was recorded. We use OpenStreetMap to identify uniquely the store where the price was recorded.
location_osm_type: The type of the OpenStreetMap location (e.g. "NODE", "WAY")
location_id: The ID of the location in the Open Prices database
date: The date when the price was recorded
proof_id: The ID of the proof of the price in the Open Prices DB
owner: a hash of the owner of the price, for privacy.
created: The date when the price was created in the Open Prices DB
updated: The date when the price was last updated in the Open Prices DB
proof_file_path: The path to the proof file in the Open Prices DB
proof_type: The type of the proof. Possible values are RECEIPT, PRICE_TAG, GDPR_REQUEST, SHOP_IMPORT
proof_date: The date of the proof
proof_currency: The currency of the proof, should be the same as the price currency
proof_created: The datetime when the proof was created in the Open Prices DB
proof_updated: The datetime when the proof was last updated in the Open Prices DB
location_osm_display_name: The display name of the OpenStreetMap location
location_osm_address_city: The city of the OpenStreetMap location
location_osm_address_postcode: The postcode of the OpenStreetMap location
How can I download images?
All images can be accessed under the https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/img/ base URL. You just have to concatenate the proof_file_path column to this base URL to get the full URL of the image (ex: https://prices.openfoodfacts.org/img/0010/lqGHf3ZcVR.webp).
